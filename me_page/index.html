    <h3>Hot Takes on Hot Food</h3>
    <p>Happy to debate any of the following. Some of these are probably not that hot if you are Chinese.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Dim Sum places often serve items in threes. Choosing a prime number of food items to be split among multiple
            diners causes unnecessary drama. </li>
        <li>Dim Sum places should serve items in 12s (thus evenly splittable among 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12 diners). </li>
        <li>That said, 3-piece Dim Sum incentivizes ordering more Dim Sum to get everyone a fair share, so maybe they're
            just being business-savvy. </li>
        <li>The Dim Sum tick-box order sheet is how all restaurants should do ordering.</li>
        <li>小笼包 should be eaten in one glorious, mouth-burning bite. </li>
        <li>Asian and Middle Eastern cuisines are irritatingly underpriced compared to the likes of Italian and French
            cuisine.</li>
    </ul>
